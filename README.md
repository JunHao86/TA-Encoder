# TA-Encoder
Using Java, created an encoder to encode and decode a message based on a given offset value. 

## Requirements:
- Takes in plaintext string to encode into another string
- Takes in an offset character to shift the table by a given value
- Provide two methods to perform encoding and decoding that takes in a single String, plainText and encodedText respectively

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or download it as a .zip file and extract its contents
2. Import the project into Eclipse or Visual Studio Code as a Maven Project
3. Run the program by executing MainProgram.java
   - Input a plaintext string to perform encoding/decoding on
   - Input an offset character to shift the reference table by (if a string is input, only the first character is taken)
   - Select menu option to perform encoding, decoding, or to exit the program
